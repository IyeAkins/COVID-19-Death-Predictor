This script is a Python code for analyzing mortality incidence and associated factors in COVID-19 patients using machine learning techniques. Here's a summary of what it does:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Imports necessary libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn.
   - Reads data from an Excel file.
   - Normalizes selected features using StandardScaler.
   - Investigates the correlation between variables and mortality.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizes various features against mortality, including age distribution, C-Reactive Protein levels, Procalcitonin levels, and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) levels.
   - Analyzes the percentage of deaths based on certain thresholds for specific variables.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Splits the data into training and testing sets.
   - Constructs a pipeline for testing different classification models like Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression.
   - Evaluates models using cross-validation, calculating accuracy and F1 score.
   - Utilizes a Voting Classifier to combine multiple models.
   - Assesses model performance using confusion matrices, classification reports, and AUC curves.
   - Performs hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest using GridSearchCV.
   - Trains the Random Forest model with optimized hyperparameters and evaluates its performance.

4. **Makes Predictions**
